### Road Blocks

- Current code along uses set paragraphs of ipsum. So each paragraph generated is the exact same as the time before... I want random sentences or chunks of sentences generated to make a unique paragraph each time. Stick with example to get things working for now.

### Immediate Plan

- Instead of each object being a preset paragraph, have hundreds of objects joined together to make a paragraph... does this require making an api?
- Look at javascript challenge?

### Future Plans

- Option to choose ipsum based on character and/or episode?
